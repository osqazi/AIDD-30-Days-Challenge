# Book Style Enhancer Skill

## When to Use This Skill

- User pastes a paragraph, scene, chapter, or any amount of book text
- User says: “make this sound more professional,” “improve the writing,” “edit for style,” “fix grammar and flow,” “make it more engaging,” or “punch up the prose”
- User wants literary-level polish without losing their unique voice

## How This Skill Works

1. **Preserve voice & intent**: Never change meaning, facts, or character tone
2. **Fix grammar & mechanics**: Eliminate errors silently
3. **Upgrade word choice**: Replace weak/repetitive words with precise, evocative ones
4. **Vary sentence rhythm**: Mix short punchy sentences with flowing longer ones
5. **Heighten sensory & emotional detail**: Show don’t tell where appropriate
6. **Tighten or expand for impact**: Remove fluff, sharpen dialogue, deepen immersion
7. **Return two versions when helpful**: Polished version + optional “more lyrical” or “more concise” variant

## Output Format

Always structure the response exactly like this:

- **Quick Summary of Changes**: 3–5 bullet points explaining the main improvements
- **Enhanced Version**: The full polished text (ready to copy-paste)
- **Optional Variants** (only if clearly better):
  - More lyrical / cinematic version
  - Tighter / faster-paced version
- **Line-by-Line Notes** (only if user asks or if major changes were made)

## Example

**Input** (user pastes this raw excerpt):
The day was very hot. She walked to the window and looked outside. The sun was shining bright and there were no clouds in the sky. She felt tired from the heat. Then she heard a knock on the door. It was him. She opened the door and he came in. He looked angry. “Where were you last night?” he asked in a loud voice.

**Output**:

- **Quick Summary of Changes**:
  - Eliminated repetitive “was” constructions and passive voice
  - Added sensory details and internal emotion to deepen immersion
  - Varied sentence length for better rhythm and tension
  - Sharpened dialogue tags and removed exclamation bloat
  - Strengthened verbs and removed filter words (“felt,” “heard”)

- **Enhanced Version**:
Heat shimmered off the pavement and pressed against the windows like an unwanted guest. Elena crossed the creaking floorboards, drawn to the open window as if cool air might still exist somewhere in the world. Outside, the sun blazed in a cloudless sky, merciless.

A knock—three sharp raps—shattered the stillness.

She opened the door. Marcus stood on the threshold, shoulders rigid, eyes storm-dark.  
“Where were you last night?” His voice cut through the thick air, low and dangerous.

- **Optional Variants**:

  **More lyrical version**:
The afternoon baked the room in white-gold light. Elena drifted to the window, a moth courting flame. Beyond the glass, the sun reigned alone, absolute and cruel, bleaching the sky to bone.

Three knocks—imperious, inevitable.

She opened the door.  
Marcus filled the frame, fury held barely in check.  
“Where were you?” he asked, the words soft as a blade sliding from its sheath.

  **Tighter / faster-paced version**:
The room felt like an oven. Elena reached the window—nothing but glaring sun and empty sky.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

She yanked the door open.  
Marcus stormed in, face hard.  
“Where were you last night?” he growled.
